# Deploy AI-First System to Replit

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

Your chatbot now uses **AI to understand ANY natural language input** instead of rigid regex patterns!

### Before:
❌ "What classes are offered in 2025 in Cornell Tech?"
→ Error: "No courses found for subject WHAT"

### After:
✅ Same query works perfectly!
→ AI extracts: Cornell Tech courses (NBAY, TECH) with year context

---

## 🚀 Deploy to Replit (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (if you set it up)

If you've set up GitHub already:

```bash
cd /Users/omermoav/Desktop/CornellCourseChat
git push origin main
```

Then in Replit Shell:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Manual Copy to Replit (Alternative)

If you haven't set up GitHub yet, manually copy these 2 files to Replit:

#### File 1: `server/ai-service.ts`
- Open this file locally
- Copy entire contents
- Paste into Replit's `server/ai-service.ts`

#### File 2: `server/answer-service.ts`
- Open this file locally
- Copy entire contents
- Paste into Replit's `server/answer-service.ts`

### Step 3: Restart Replit Server

**Option A:** Click **Stop** then **Run** button

**Option B:** In Replit Shell:
```bash
pkill node
```

Replit will auto-restart with the new code!

## ✅ Test These Queries

Once deployed, try these in your Replit app:

### 1. Natural Language Queries
```
"What classes are offered in 2025 in Cornell Tech?"
"Tell me about Cornell Tech courses"
"Show me AI classes"
"What machine learning courses are available?"
```

### 2. Off-Topic Questions (Should be politely rejected)
```
"What's the weather today?"
"How do I apply to Cornell?"
"Tell me a joke"
```

### 3. Follow-Up Questions
```
First: "What is NBAY 6170?"
Then: "Who teaches it?"
Then: "What are the prerequisites?"
```

### 4. Specific Courses (Still work great!)
```
"What is CS 2110?"
"Is CS 4780 pass/fail?"
"Prerequisites for ORIE 3500?"
```

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Issue: "AI couldn't generate answer"
**Solution:** Check OpenAI API key in Replit Secrets

### Issue: Same errors as before
**Solution:** Server didn't restart. Run `pkill node` in Shell

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution:** Run `npm install` in Replit Shell

### Issue: Off-topic questions not rejected
**Solution:** Verify `ai-service.ts` was updated correctly

## 🎓 Key Changes Made

### 1. New AI Query Understanding
- `aiService.understandQuery()` method
- Analyzes user intent with GPT-4o-mini
- Extracts subjects, terms, query types
- Determines relevance to Cornell courses

### 2. Enhanced Answer Service
- AI understanding runs FIRST
- Rejects off-topic questions politely
- Uses AI-extracted subjects when patterns fail
- Maintains conversation context

### 3. Graceful Fallbacks
- Still uses pattern matching for well-formed queries
- AI enhances, doesn't replace, existing functionality
- Error handling at every step

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Get the Most from the AI System:

1. **Ask naturally** - No need to follow specific patterns
2. **Use follow-ups** - "Who teaches it?" after asking about a course
3. **Be conversational** - The AI understands context
4. **Try variations** - Different ways of asking work!

### Examples:
- "Cornell Tech courses" = "What classes does Cornell Tech offer?"
- "Machine learning" = "AI courses" = "ML classes"
- "Fall 2025 CS" = "CS classes in fall 2025"

All work! 🎉

## 🎉 You're Done!

Once deployed and tested, your chatbot will:
- Handle any natural language input
- Politely stay on-topic
- Provide helpful suggestions
- Maintain conversation context
- Never show confusing "No courses found for WHAT" errors again!
