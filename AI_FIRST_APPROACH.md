# AI-First Query Understanding

## üéØ New Approach: From Pattern Matching to AI Understanding

### The Problem We Fixed

**Old Approach (Pattern-Based):**
- Used rigid regex patterns to parse queries
- Failed on natural language variations
- Extracted "WHAT" as a subject code from "What classes are offered in 2025?"
- Couldn't handle: "Cornell Tech courses", "classes in 2025", "machine learning courses"

**New Approach (AI-First):**
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to understand user intent
- Works with ANY natural language input
- Gracefully handles and rejects off-topic questions
- Extracts subjects, terms, and query types intelligently

---

## üß† How It Works

### Step 1: AI Query Understanding

When a user asks a question, the AI first analyzes it:

```typescript
const understanding = await aiService.understandQuery(query, conversationHistory);
```

The AI determines:
- **Is this relevant** to Cornell courses?
- **What subjects** are mentioned? (CS, INFO, NBAY, etc.)
- **What type** of query is it?
  - `specific_course`: "What is CS 2110?"
  - `subject_courses`: "What CS courses are offered?"
  - `general_inquiry`: "Tell me about machine learning"
  - `off_topic`: "What's the weather?"
- **What information** is being requested? (term, year, prerequisites, etc.)

### Step 2: Smart Response Routing

Based on AI understanding:

1. **Off-Topic Questions** ‚Üí Polite rejection with suggestions
2. **Subject Queries** ‚Üí Use AI-extracted subjects to search database
3. **Specific Courses** ‚Üí Use traditional parser + AI enhancement
4. **General Inquiries** ‚Üí AI-generated helpful response

### Step 3: Context-Aware Responses

- Maintains conversation history
- Understands follow-up questions
- Provides helpful suggestions
- Explains data limitations (e.g., semester availability)

## ‚úÖ What Now Works

### Natural Language Variations

**Before:** ‚ùå "What classes are offered in 2025 in Cornell Tech?"
- Error: "No courses found for subject WHAT"

**After:** ‚úÖ Same query works!
- AI extracts: subjects: ["NBAY", "TECH"], year: "2025"
- Shows Cornell Tech courses with temporal context

### Broad Queries

‚úÖ "What classes are offered in 2025 in Cornell Tech?"
‚úÖ "Tell me about Cornell Tech courses"
‚úÖ "What machine learning courses are available?"
‚úÖ "Show me AI classes"
‚úÖ "What can I take at Cornell Tech?"

### Off-Topic Questions

**Query:** "What's the weather today?"

**Response:**
```
I appreciate your question, but I'm specifically designed to help 
with Cornell University course information. I can answer questions about:

‚Ä¢ Specific courses (e.g., "What is CS 2110?")
‚Ä¢ Course schedules and instructors
‚Ä¢ Prerequisites and requirements
‚Ä¢ Grading policies
‚Ä¢ Learning outcomes
‚Ä¢ Available courses in different subjects

Feel free to ask me anything about Cornell courses!
```

### Follow-Up Questions

**Conversation:**
```
User: "What Cornell Tech courses are offered?"
Bot: [Shows NBAY and TECH courses]

User: "Tell me more about the AI course"
Bot: [Understands context, searches for AI-related courses]

User: "What's the weather?"
Bot: [Politely redirects to course questions]
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New AI Service Method

```typescript
async understandQuery(
  userQuestion: string, 
  conversationHistory?: ChatMessage[]
): Promise<QueryUnderstanding>
```

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  isRelevant: true/false,
  reasoning: "User is asking about Cornell Tech courses for 2025",
  extractedInfo: {
    subjects: ["NBAY", "TECH"],
    catalogNumber: null,
    term: null,
    year: "2025",
    queryType: "subject_courses"
  },
  suggestedQuery: null
}
```

### Enhanced Answer Service

The answer service now:
1. **First** uses AI to understand the query
2. **Checks** if the question is relevant
3. **Rejects** off-topic questions politely
4. **Uses AI-extracted subjects** when pattern matching fails
5. **Falls back** to traditional parsing for well-formed queries

## üéØ Test Cases

### Test 1: Natural Language with Year

```
Query: "What classes are offered in 2025 in Cornell Tech?"

Expected: Shows NBAY/TECH courses with note about data from [current term]
```

### Test 2: Broad Subject Query

```
Query: "Tell me about Cornell Tech courses"

Expected: Lists NBAY and TECH courses with AI summary
```

### Test 3: Off-Topic Question

```
Query: "What's the weather today?"

Expected: Polite rejection with course-related suggestions
```

### Test 4: Ambiguous Query

```
Query: "Show me AI classes"

Expected: AI interprets as CS/INFO machine learning courses
```

### Test 5: Follow-Up Question

```
Conversation:
1. "What is NBAY 6170?"
2. "Who teaches it?"

Expected: Second question references NBAY 6170 from context
```

### Test 6: Misspelled/Unclear Query

```
Query: "coarse about machne lerning"

Expected: AI understands intent, shows ML-related courses
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### API Calls
- **1 additional OpenAI call** per user query for understanding
- Fast (~200-300ms typical response time)
- Cached conversation context for efficiency
- Falls back gracefully on API errors

### Cost
- GPT-4o-mini is very affordable (~$0.00015 per request)
- JSON mode for consistent parsing
- Lower temperature (0.3) for deterministic results

### Reliability
- **Fallback to traditional parser** if AI fails
- **Default to relevant** if uncertain (better to try than reject)
- Error handling at every step

## üîÑ Migration Path

### Old System Still Works
- Traditional pattern matching as fallback
- Well-formed queries (e.g., "What is CS 2110?") still fast
- No breaking changes

### New System Handles Edge Cases
- Natural language variations
- Ambiguous queries
- Off-topic questions
- Follow-up questions with context
